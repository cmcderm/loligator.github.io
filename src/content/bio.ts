# Greetings, fellow human!
My name is Connor McDermott, I am a Software Engineer with a love for gameplay programming, .NET, Linux, and Pizza.

I am currently looking for full-time work! My work is mostly focused on .NET and web development. I typically take on a full stack approach, as I like to have a sense of what goes on top to bottom, otherwise debugging can get very mysterious!

While it's not my day job, I'm very passionate about Game Development as a hobby. I always have a game project in progress! I'm currently (slowly) working on a Resident Evil inspired top-down shooter in Unity.
